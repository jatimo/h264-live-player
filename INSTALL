## Installation instructions

## Server side

## - Install nodejs on target server host. This was tested with nodejs v9.3.0. from nvm based install. 
## - Ensure git and npm are available.
## - Clone or download respository found here.  https://github.com/jatimo/h264-live-player or use below command

#! git clone https://github.com/jatimo/h264-live-player.git

#! cd h264-live-player
#! npm install

## Modify service-settings.json appropriately. The "intra" setting determines how many frames are sent before a 
## key frame will be added. When a new client starts a live stream without a key frame yet available, they may experience
## momentary blue or green screens, or garbled video data until a new key frame is sent. A setting of 1 will ensure every
## frame is a key frame (never garbled video), at the expense of much lower quality and/or increased bandwidth. A setting
## of 12 for 25fps ensures  there is never longer than about 500ms garbled video at worst, with acceptable video quality.

## The below command will run the service. This service is responsible for connecting to the RasPi in the config 
## settings, and receiving its raw video data. It parses the NAL frames so that the video can be delivered one frame
## at a time to the client (in the browser). 

#! node ./raspi-relay-server.js

## The server on startup will output an appropriate line for use on the raspberry pi. The raspberry pi host 
## does not need any special software to function in this role beyond the raspivid utility.
